    title = "Cryptocurrency Market Manipulation: A Systematic Literature Review",
    abstract = "Cryptocurrencies, a new class of digital asset predominantly based on blockchain technologies, have gained immense popularity in recent years. Despite of advantages over traditional monetary systems such as lower transaction cost, increased transactional security, or transparency, cryptocurrencies are not free of disadvantages. The increase in popularity has also led to an increase in market manipulation in these markets. While there has been some attempt to identify and classify various cryptocurrency market manipulation schemes, there is a distinct need for a holistic description and classification of current cryptocurrency market manipulation schemes. Therefore, based on a systematic literature review, this paper provides an overview of cryptocurrency market manipulation methods using a concept-centric approach, a characterization of these methods, and identifies market vulnerabilities.",

  abstract = {Market manipulation through buy-and-sell has always been and persists to be a serious challenge for market participants and supervisors, and as markets are expanded, the number, types, and complexity of its manipulation methods grow day-by-day. Thus,several studies have been conducted to detect these types of manipulations. Despite the undeniable importance of this problem, there has been no review on that. This paper, as a pioneer in this area, has done a systematic review of the literature on market manipulation detection from 2010 to 2020, and the 52 most significant studies were reviewed and analyzed deeply and comprehensively. In the selected studies, a review has been conducted on the definitions and taxonomies of trade-based manipulation; the objectives; issue investigated; methodology; strengths and weaknesses; proposed solutions; data mining approaches, categories and techniques; and also, on the different types of manipulations and anomalies investigated, and the future works suggested in the studies. The most important results of this paper are as the following: an in-depth review and critique of the studies, proposition of new and practical solutions to manipulation detection, mapping of manipulations with anomalies, identification of the challenges facing in manipulation detection and the open problems in this area, identification of types of manipulations and anomalies, the detection methods and approaches, the data mining categories and trade-based manipulation taxonomy criteria. The results of this paper will help to understand the methods of manipulation and how to detect them in electronic financial markets, and can be a guide for future researchers to conduct the necessary research in this field, and also for the selection of scientific approaches to solve the open problems raised in this paper.}
