\emph{Fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions represent an ongoing and significant threat within the digital asset ecosystem,
demanding robust detection mechanisms. Identifying such illicit activities is complicated by the complex nature of transaction
data and, critically, the prevalent scarcity of labeled illicit examples in available datasets. This paper conducts a comprehensive
empirical evaluation of the Energy Flow Classifier (EFC), a physics-inspired one-class anomaly detection model, for identifying
illicit Bitcoin transactions using the Elliptic dataset, specifically addressing its performance under conditions of label
scarcity. Our findings demonstrate that EFC can effectively distinguish illicit from licit transactions when trained
exclusively on normal data, with its performance significantly enhanced by combining feature selection and data balancing
techniques like SMOTE, achieving strong results even on imbalanced test sets.}
