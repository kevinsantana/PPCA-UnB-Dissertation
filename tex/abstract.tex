\emph{Mercado Bitcoin, a Brazilian cryptocurrency exchange, has facilitated over 50 billion reais in trading since 2013,
offering +200 assets to more than 3.7 million clients. Recent attention has triggered a surge in cryptocurrency-related
fraudulent activities, primarily due to its inherent anonymity. Financial market abuse, detrimental to market
functioning, occurs in three main categories: information-based manipulation, action-based manipulation, and trade-based
manipulation \cite{allen1992stock}. Trade-based abuse often involves price manipulation, specifically targeting equity
bid/ask prices \cite{allen1992stock, allen2006large}. This research focuses on the category of market manipulation known
as price manipulation. Using anomaly detection tools, we will analyze post-trading phase public data from Mercado
Bitcoin API to identify and flag anomalous transactions, which is raised bby analyzing the historical transaction data
from a given cryptocurrency. Subsequently, a back office analysis will determine the fraudulent nature of these
transactions.}
