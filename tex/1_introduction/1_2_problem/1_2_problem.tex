\section{Problem}
Anomalous transactions pose a threat to the exchange's reputation, potential client acquisition, and trading volume,
significantly impacting its revenue model based on transaction taxes. Decreased transactions not only directly affect
revenue but also risk regulatory fines for non-compliance, while users may cease trading due to perceived transaction
unfairness.

Currently, Mercado Bitcoin relies solely on United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) 1267 to freeze funds
related to terrorism financing and Interpol fugitives/wanted persons. However, there is a pressing need for a mechanism
capable of analyzing trading data, distinguishing anomalous from non-anomalous transactions. This would enable a human
back office to determine if anomalies indicate any form of market manipulation.
