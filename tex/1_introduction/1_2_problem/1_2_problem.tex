\section{Problem}
Financial frauds are not unique to the stock market, cryptocurrency and the Bitcoin ecosystem can be victims of such
manipulation. These scams have been extensively researched in traditional stock markets, but there is a lack of deeper
and more scientific research on their prevalence and impact in the cryptocurrency space. Such scams pose a significant
threat to cryptocurrency exchanges as they can manipulate prices, resulting in potential revenue losses and damage to
credibility. Due to the complex nature of these frauds, advanced Artificial Intelligence Models can be applied to detect
and prevent them \cite{zhang2020financial, zainal2018review}.

Although these scams have been extensively researched in traditional stock markets, there is a lack of literature about
the use of ML techniques to detect and prevent them on cryptocurrency markets. Therefore, our initial goal is to analyze
the public trading data from Mercado Bitcoin using different Machine Learning techniques to, first, investigate if there
is indication of fraud on the trading data, and second the type of anomalies. Moreover, if these anomalies are know and
if we can compare them to the stock market and other financial domains \cite{bhattacharyya2011survey}.
