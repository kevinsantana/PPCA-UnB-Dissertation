\section{Aims and Objectives}
\textit{\textbf{Aim Statement:} Crypto scams have cost people more than \$1 billion since 2021, according to U.S.
Federal Trade Comission. On top of that, there is very little monitoring of manipulative trading. This project seeks to
examine the trading data of criptocurrencies on Mercado Bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange, to detect anomalies and what
kind of anomalies they are, according to other researches on the stock market. The research will use Artificial
Intelligence techniques to conclude either or not the Bitcoin market can be target to such scams.}

\textit{\textbf{Research Question:} Given a dataset composed of trading data on a cryptocurrency exchange, can we
determine if there is anomalies on the data and classify them?}

    \item[] \textbf{Objectives}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collect trading data from Mercado Bitcoin public api;
        \item Prepare and transform the collected data;
        \item Apply fine-tuning techniques on already pre-trained artificial intelligence models;
        \item Train a variaty of machine learning, deep learning and large language models;
        \item Evaluate these models by deliberate inserting fraudulent data and check either or not the model will
        detect those manipulations;
        \item Compare the results against well know and established models;
        \item Collect and debate the results.
