\section{Aims and Objectives}
\textit{\textbf{Aim Statement:} Crypto scams have cost people more than \$1 billion since 2021, according to U.S. Federal Trade Comission. On top of that, there is very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. This project seeks to examine the trading data of Bitcoin on Mercado Bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange. The research will use Artificial Intelligence techniques and models to conclude either or not the Bitcoin market can be target to such scams.}

    \item[] \textbf{Objectives}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collect trading data from Mercado Bitcoin public api;
        \item Prepare and transform the collected data;
        \item Apply multiple artificial intelligence models;
        \item Train a variaty of machine learning, deep learning and large language models;
        \item Evaluate these models by deliberate inserting fraudulent data and check either or not the model will detect those manipulations;
        \item Compare the results against well know and established models;
        \item Collect and debate the results.
