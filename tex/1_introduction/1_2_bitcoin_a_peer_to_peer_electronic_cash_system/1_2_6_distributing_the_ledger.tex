\subsubsection{Distributing The Ledger}
The distributed nature of the blockchain technology used by the ledger system necessitates the use of a centralized platform
for public access and modification of the ledger's contents. However, this raises concerns regarding the trustworthiness
of the entity responsible for hosting the website and regulating the rules governing the addition of new entries to the
ledger. In particular, it is important to identify and evaluate the credibility of the entity that controls the website
and establishes the protocols for updating the ledger.

To eliminate trust in a centralized system where one ledger is maintained, we will replace this with a decentralized approach,
where each individual will maintain their own copy of the ledger. This will enable transactions, such as "Alice pays Bob
100 LD" to be broadcasted and recorded on personal ledgers by all parties involved in the network.

The distributed ledger technology employed by Bitcoin involves the broadcast of transactions by users, which are then recorded
on a decentralized set of records. This eliminates the need for trust in a central authority. However, this system is problematic
due to the possibility of disagreement among participants regarding the correct ledger. For example, when Bob receives a
transaction "Alice pays Bob 10 LD", how can he be certain that everyone else has received and believes in the same transaction?
If even one person does not know about this transaction, they may not allow Bob to spend those 10 Ledger Dollars later.

The verification of the integrity and consensus of a blockchain network relies on a distributed ledger system where all
participants maintain a copy of the same transaction history. The trustworthiness of this system is predicated on the assumption
that all nodes will accurately record and remember past transactions, which may be subject to potential inconsistencies
or discrepancies in the event of faulty or malicious behavior. Therefore, it is essential to establish a mechanism for
ensuring that the distributed ledger remains consistent across all participating nodes. The solution proposed by Satoshi
Nakamoto in 2008 for decentralized systems was a method to validate the validity of a growing document, such as a ledger,
without relying on a central authority. This problem was solved through the use of computational work to determine trustworthiness,
where the ledger with the most computational effort invested in it is considered legitimate. The idea is that if an individual
attempts to manipulate the ledger, it would require an impractical amount of computational power, making fraudulent transactions
computationally infeasible. This concept forms the core of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
