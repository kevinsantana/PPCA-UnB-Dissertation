\section{Context}
At Mercado Bitcoin, users engage in crypto trading via the trading API, mobile app, and website. The trading engine
processes millions of operations, matching buy and sell orders. Two types of end users exist: market makers,
contributing to the order book depth, and retail users engaging in non-automatic trading. Despite user type, opposing
orders result in matches by day's end. Presently lacking a fraud detection mechanism for price manipulation, all orders,
regardless of authenticity, enter the order book.

From a retail perspective, this aligns with the expected behavior, as the exchange derives revenue from individual order
taxes. However, the market's anonymous, decentralized, and unregulated nature makes it susceptible to manipulation. To
address this, we analyze public trading data from Mercado Bitcoin API for anomalies and suspicious activities, focusing
on order book data (buy and sell with price and volume) and trade data (historical transactions). Initially exploring
Bitcoin historical data from 2013 onwards, we plan to extend our analysis to other cryptocurrencies if inconsistencies
emerge in Bitcoin data during the research.
