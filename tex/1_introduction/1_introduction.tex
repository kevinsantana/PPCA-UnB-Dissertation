\section{The Rise Of Money}
Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged in late 2008, some say in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, others in response to the highly burecatic and not so friendly
japanese banking system.
The last claim can be viewed as more conspiratorial than anything else, not for any other reason than the belief that the original author or authors
of the Bitcoin whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} might have come from Japan.
Prior to talking about Bitcoin, we need to talk about money and most important on its underlying concept: value.

What is Money? Or rather, what does money represent?

\subsection{What is Money}
If we asked the question: \textit{What is man's greatest invention?} What would your answer be?
There's a lot of options. 
Would it be fire? Because it gives us warmth, protection, and the ability to cook our meals? Or perhaps you would pick the wheel? Because it's the driving
force being the beginnings of trade, commerce, and travel.
While both of those are excellent choices, most of the time when we think about the greatest inventions of mankind, we tend to forget one of the most
important ones of all: money.

Unlike tangible inventions such as fire and the wheel, money possesses an immaterial nature. It exists as a conceptual construct, lacking inherent value,
and its significance is derived solely from the subjective importance we attribute to it. This intangible nature of money often distinguishes it from other
notable inventions in the collective human consciousness. \cite{smith2010wealth}.

Notwithstanding the illusory nature of money, its significance remains unaffected. Prior to the establishment of monetary systems, human societies engaged
in direct exchange of goods and services known as the Barter system. In this system, individuals traded commodities without an assigned intrinsic value,
relying solely on subjective evaluations of desired items. Consequently, each transaction was contingent upon the willingness of parties involved to forfeit
possessions in pursuit of their desired commodities. Such an exchange mechanism resembled a game-like scenario \cite{durlauf2016new}.

If a situation arose where I desired vegetables for my meal, but my only possession was cattle, I would be obliged to offer one of my animals in exchange for
bags of vegetables. Similarly, if I required footwear but specialized in tent production, I would have to surrender an entire tent to obtain a pair of slippers.
This barter-based system reveals a prominent issue known as asymmetry. As a tent-maker, the exchange of an entire dwelling for simple footwear would undoubtedly
leave me feeling disadvantaged. The absence of a standardized medium of exchange presented significant challenges in facilitating agreements between individuals
with disparate needs. Moreover, the reliance on a fortuitous occurrence of complementary wants, wherein two individuals simultaneously sought the reciprocal
possession, further complicated matters, rendering the process inefficient \cite{goodhart1998two}.

Our monetary system serves not only as a medium of exchange but also as a store of value. However, prior to the advent of money, certain individuals were
unable to effectively preserve their wealth through no fault of their own. Consider the scenario of a farmer selling tomatoes and a tent maker. The tent
maker has the ability to amass a substantial portfolio of real estate in the form of tents, which can be bartered year-round with individuals in need of
shelter. Consequently, the tent maker has the opportunity to accumulate wealth. In contrast, the farmer selling tomatoes can only engage in barter
transactions during the tomato season. Moreover, due to the perishable nature of tomatoes, long-term storage is not feasible. Thus, despite exerting
comparable efforts in their respective businesses, the farmer had no viable means to sustain wealth throughout the year \cite{de2016origins}.

There's also the problem of having something that only very few people want. Nowadays, when starting a business, you're often told to find a niche. A small
group of people who are very interested in what you have to offer. Before money was a thing, that advice would have left you with nothing worth bartering.

In societies where possessions of high demand, such as weapons, animal skins, and salt, held significant value, individuals who possessed such commodities
acquired substantial wealth. The awareness that these items were universally sought-after prompted individuals to engage in anticipatory buying, even if
immediate need was absent, to secure future trading opportunities. As a consequence, the emergence of commodity money ensued, whereby goods and services
were exchanged for commonly recognized items such as salt or weapons, facilitating subsequent transactions with other parties \cite{polanyi1965trade}.

Humanity progressed beyond direct barter, encompassing a diverse range of commodities including salt, weapons, and minute collectibles like shells and beads.
This evolution introduced a more efficient method of trade and exchange. Rather than directly swapping goods and services, individuals adopted the practice
of using arbitrary objects as intermediary placeholders of value, effectively functioning as IOUs (I Owe You). Subsequently, these placeholders could be
utilized to acquire desired goods and services from others. This concept proved remarkably ingenious, ultimately leading to a global transition from the
Barter system to the monetary exchange system \cite{graeber2012debt}.

However, there has been a persistent limitation associated with this form of exchange. In order for currency to exhibit intrinsic value, it requires a degree
of scarcity \cite{smith2010wealth, ricardo1821principles}. The more easily accessible an item is, the lower its perceived worth \cite{marshall2009principles}.
When an item is readily obtainable by anyone, its value diminishes considerably. As a result, substances such as sand or shells, which can be effortlessly
collected from any beach, do not effectively function as indicators of value \cite{principlesmenger, hicks1936keynes}.

In approximately 770 BC, China witnessed the emergence of the earliest metal coins, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of currency. As a
tribute to their historical currency systems, the Chinese craftsmen ingeniously crafted miniature replicas of tools that were previously utilized as
forms of exchange. With the intention of ensuring convenient handling, the coins were deliberately designed in a circular shape, allowing easy retrieval
from pockets without causing any discomfort to the fingers. These coins were predominantly cast using bronze, thereby bestowing intrinsic value upon them.
This transition marked a pivotal moment in history, as money transformed from a mere symbol to a tangible entity of worth. The scarcity of bronze, a
resource not readily available on any beach, further amplified the significance of these coins \cite{li2003, hartill2005}.

During this period, the concept of money had not yet deviated from material reality. The valuation of a coin corresponded directly to the intrinsic value
of the metal constituting the coin. For instance, a coin crafted from 1 gram of gold possessed an equivalent worth of precisely 1 gram of gold. This
quantifiable attribute allowed for straightforward verification through direct measurement, enabling individuals to visually ascertain that the coin
indeed comprised 1 gram of gold.

The realization of the potential power of money was swift among Kings and Rulers, as highlighted by Cribb \cite{cribb1991}. This understanding led to the
creation of the first official money mint by Alyattes, the King of Lydia, around 600 BC. These coins were minted from a blend of silver and gold, with
each coin featuring a distinctive image serving as a denomination. Consequently, individuals could effortlessly determine the value of their metal
possession by observing the pictorial representation on the coin's surface \cite{deVries2008}.

The pursuit of greater wealth among Kings led to the devaluation of coins through the reduction of precious metal content and the inclusion of cheaper
metals, as highlighted by Weatherford \cite{weatherford1997}. This resulted in the divergence between the face value and actual worth of circulating
coins, establishing the illusion of money. The value of coins became divorced from the intrinsic value of their metal composition, relying instead on
the dictates of rulers and financial institutions \cite{ferguson2009}. As an example, the British Pound Sterling ceased to represent a fixed quantity
of Sterling Silver and instead denoted a unit of currency determined by authoritative decree.

The emergence of international trade exposed the impracticality of metal coins, leading to the introduction of IOU certificates by Kings to facilitate
long-distance transactions, as discussed by Graeber \cite{graeber2011}. These certificates, bearing the King's stamp, gained trust and were believed
to hold value, as they were expected to be exchangeable for equivalent coins. Initially, this belief corresponded to reality.

With the proliferation of IOU certificates in circulation, the necessity for physical coins diminished. Ultimately, the value of the certificates became
divorced from their direct convertibility into gold and silver coins. Instead, their value relied on collective trust and shared belief, as highlighted
by Ingham \cite{ingham2004}. This shift allowed the paper certificates to retain value based on our perception, even in the absence of immediate exchange
for tangible precious metals.

\subsection{The Illusion of Money}
From Ancient Kings to modern day governments and Central Banks, money has remained an illusion. A mere representation whose value is determined by
the importance people place on it.
