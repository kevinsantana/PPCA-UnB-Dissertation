\section{The Rise Of Money}
Bitcoin has emerged in late 2008, some say in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, others in response to the highly burecatic and not so friendly
japanese banking system.
The last claim can be view as more conspirancy than anything else, not for other reason than the believe that the original author or authors of the Bitcoin
whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} might came from Japan.
