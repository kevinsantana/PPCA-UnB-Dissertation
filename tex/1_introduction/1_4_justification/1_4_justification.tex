\section{Justification}
Mercado Bitcoin has facilitated a total trading volume of 50 billion reais since its 2013 inception, with 200 assets and
3.8 million active clients. Bitcoin constitutes 40\% of the \$1 trillion in total crypto assets.

Implementing an anomaly detection mechanism is imperative for enhancing Mercado Bitcoin's revenue, user trust, and
compliance with regulators and investors. This effort stands to benefit Brazilian authorities, particularly the
\textit{Comissão de Valores Mobiliários} (CVM) and \textit{Banco Central do Brasil} (BACEN). Additionally, it aligns
with the recent legislative project, PL 4401/2021, passed by the \textit{Câmara dos Deputados}, introducing increased
regulation to the cryptocurrency sector.
