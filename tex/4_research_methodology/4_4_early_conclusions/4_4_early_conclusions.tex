\section{Early Conclusions}
This dissertation aims to employ machine learning techniques to identify anomalies in the Bitcoin market, which are
tactics used by scammers to manipulate Bitcoin prices. We will utilize two datasets, one for market forecasts and the
other for real-time Bitcoin prices, obtained from the public endpoint of the Mercado Bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange.
Employing the Design Science Research Process, we will develop various machine learning models to detect these
fraudulent activities, potentially leading to the creation of an innovative model applicable to other cryptocurrency
contexts and anomaly analyses.

The absence of effective mechanisms to identify and prevent such fraudulent actions poses a risk to the exchange's
reputation, revenue, and market share. Legal consequences may also arise, as traders, companies, individuals, and
government authorities may take legal action against the exchange. Moreover, failing to address these anomalies can
hinder the cryptocurrency economy's progress and the development of the broader web3 economy.
