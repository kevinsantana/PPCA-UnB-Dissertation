\subsection{Blockchain}
A distributed ledger system is composed of multiple nodes that broadcast transactions. To ensure consensus on the correct ledger, it is necessary to develop a mechanism that allows all nodes to agree on the validity of each transaction~\cite{el2018review}.

The core concept of the original Bitcoin paper~\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} is based on the assumption that a distributed ledger will be trusted if it has been subject to a large amount of computational effort. This idea is implemented through the use of the many-zeroes game, which involves proving that a particular block in the chain contains a hash that is difficult to reverse-engineer.

Rather than hashing the entire ledger repeatedly, it is more efficient to allow for the accumulation of computational effort over time. Transactions are grouped into blocks and added to the chain in a linear fashion, with each new block containing a reference to the previous one. This approach allows for the creation of a tamper-evident history of transactions that is trusted by network participants due to the large amount of computational work required to manipulate it.

The block is a collection of transactions enclosed with a unique identifier, known as proof-of-work (PoW), which serves as evidence of the computational effort expended in validating the block. In PoW schemes, the miner must solve a complex mathematical problem to validate the block and add it to the blockchain. The difficulty level of this problem is determined by the target number of leading zeros required in the hash value of the block.

A block is considered valid if it contains a proof-of-work (PoW) value, analogous to how a transaction is only considered valid when signed by its sender. Additionally, maintaining the integrity of the blockchain requires that blocks are not rearranged as this would disrupt the transaction history. To address this issue, each new block must begin with the hash of the previous block (hash-based chain), ensuring that the order of the blocks remains consistent.
